## Project X

The project is developed using modern React, Typescript and Vite technologies. Tailwind and CSS(SCSS) were used for interface design.

## Features

- The application consists of different pages, each showcasing unique animations created with Framer Motion.

- The navigation section uses Swiper and Framer Motion for smooth and dynamic transitions.

- The project is fully responsive, ensuring optimal performance and appearance on all device sizes.

- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for efficient and modular design adjustments.

- Includes SCSS for advanced and organized styling capabilities.

- Built with React for a robust and flexible user interface.

- Uses Vite for fast and efficient development and build processes.

- Implemented with TypeScript for type safety and improved code quality. 

## Technologies:

- **React.js:**  A modern and fast library for building user interfaces.

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language.

- **Vite:** Uses Vite for fast and efficient development and build processes.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A fast and flexible CSS framework, customized for this project to provide quick and simple styling.

- **SCSS:** A more powerful and feature-rich extension of CSS that enables better organization and maintainability of stylesheets.

- **Framer Motion:** An animation library for React, used to easily add animations to the project. 

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
